# D&D 4e power cards generator (v2)
This is heavily inspired in https://tools.omnichron.net/dnd/pow.html, for the moment this is only for PCs powers and no more tools.

# Local

```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```

# Why with Svelte now?
1. I wanted to check out how Svelte is used
2. The first version is really slow, partially because I'm not good with React

# Bugs/To-dos
- [ ] With some dimensions if the card has two icons then it will misalign
- [ ] If there are no icons or title or level then the title bar of the card is not rendered

-  Load files
